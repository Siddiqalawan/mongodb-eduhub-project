# PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS RESULTS

## Task 4.1: Complex Queries

#### Courses with price between $50 and $200
| Course ID | Course Title                    | Price (USD) |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| C003      | Unit Testing in Python          | \$100       |
| C005      | Computer Vision with OpenCV     | \$150       |
| C006      | Deep Learning with TensorFlow   | \$150       |
| C007      | Data Visualization with Seaborn | \$50        |
| C008      | Unit Testing in Python          | \$50        |
| C701      | Machine Learning Foundation     | \$150       |

## üéØ Key Observations
### üîπ Pricing Strategy
Prices range from $50 to $150, hitting a sweet spot for learners‚Äîaffordable yet premium.
C003 vs C008: Same course title but priced differently ‚Äî shows a strategy of tiered offerings (basic vs full version, or seasonal discounts).

### üîπ Content Focus
Most courses fall into AI/ML/Data space, which aligns with current job market demand.
Courses like C005, C006, and C701 are likely in high demand due to their advanced and applied nature.

üîπ Enrollment Impact:
C701 had 3 enrollments (strong for a $150 course).
C006 had 4 enrollments (top performer).
C007 had 2 enrollments (lowest priced; may serve as a lead magnet).
C005 had 1 enrollment (may need marketing push despite technical depth).
C008 had 1 enrollment (priced lower, but could be competing with C003).
C003 did not appear in enrollment data, may be underperforming or not yet live.

## ‚úÖ Summary: Query Optimization & Execution Stats
| **Metric**                   | **Details**                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Execution Time**           | `0 ms` ‚Äì Query executed very quickly.                                      |
| **Total Documents Examined** | `2` ‚Äì MongoDB only scanned 2 documents to find the result.                 |
| **Index Used**               | `title_1_category_1` ‚Äì A compound index on `title` and `category` fields.  |
| **Query Type**               | `Regex search` on title + `Equality match` on category.                    |
| **Winning Plan**             | `IXSCAN` (Index Scan) ‚Üí `FETCH` ‚Äì Efficient use of index to retrieve docs. |
| **Index Efficiency**         | High ‚Äì Query used the appropriate compound index and avoided full scan.    |

## üîç Key Takeaways
Efficient Query: The index on title and category was effectively used, avoiding a collection scan.
Low Document Scan Count: Only 2 documents examined means minimal resource usage.
Fast Execution: With 0 ms runtime, this is a highly optimized query.
Regex Support in Index: The query used a case-insensitive regex on the title field, which was still index-supported thanks to the regex's nature and index ordering.


## ‚úÖ Summary: Query Optimization on enrollments Collection
| **Metric**               | **Details**                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Query Target**         | `enrollments` collection                                    |
| **Query Condition**      | `student_id = "U004"`                                       |
| **Execution Plan**       | **Index Scan (`IXSCAN`)** followed by **Fetch (`FETCH`)**   |
| **Index Used**           | `student_id_1`                                              |
| **Index Bounds**         | `["U004", "U004"]` ‚Äì Narrow scan using equality match       |
| **Documents Examined**   | Not shown, but very likely **minimal** due to index use     |
| **Query Execution Time** | Fast (exact time not specified, but near-instant)           |
| **Optimization Flags**   | All optimization limits (`maxScansToExplode`, etc.) avoided |



## üîç Key Points
Efficient Index Use: The query used the student_id_1 index to quickly locate matching enrollment documents.
Precise Bounds: The bounds show that it searched exactly for "U004" with no range or full scan.
Minimal Cost: Since student_id is likely a low-cardinality field and the query is exact-match, MongoDB didn't need to scan many documents.

Optimization implementation can be found in the eduhub_mongodb_project.ipynb, under Task 5.
